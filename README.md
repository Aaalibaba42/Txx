Txx
===

Basicly the goal is to create a functional language using only the C++ Type
System. No literals, No standard library, no constexpr, just the Typesystem.
In other words, there are 0 (zero) *values* in the code, just Types.

The goal would be to be able to solve a few [Advent of
Code](https://adventofcode.com/) exercises using only this.

I was very much inspired by my former colleague's
[funxx](https://github.com/VokunGahrotLaas/funxx), but wanted to go even
further.

This document is merely an overview of the project, if you want to dive deep in
the technology, AI redacted a [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) that I proof
read.

AI
--

Before the commit adding this mention (a5e9a45), no code was generated by AI.
Now that the language is pretty well formed and works well enough, I intend to
use AI for repetitive tasks that are pretty trivial but needs modifications in
lots of places, that I just don't feel like doing, or find not interesting but
necessary. For intance, the `polymorphism` refactor (04c8f12) could have been
done by hand on a few examples, and then let the AI do the rest. This refactor
was really not interesting in the code production part, and took a while, I
stepped away from the project for a while because of it, and I don't want to
abandon because of menial tasks like this one. AI use will always be
transparent and documented in the concerned code or in the commit messages.

Features
--------

### Entry point

You have 2 things for an entry point, a `prelude.txx`, and a `body.txx` file.
The prelude is functions you may need before the body of your main function,
it's like the context of your program. The body is the *content* of the `struct
Main` implementation. It is akin to the body of a main function in other
languages.

You ought to change the paths to files in `main.hh` to your paths to
`prelude.txx` and `body.txx`.

> Note: These files can be named anything really, just include them accordingly
in `main.hh`.

For example, the [factorial](./samples/factorial) sample can be compiled with
the following command:
```sh
42sh$ # -std=c++23 -pedantic: C++ standard to use, pendantic to not use language
42sh$ #                       extension (you can also enable most warnings)
42sh$ # -D_TXX_SKIP_TESTS: Tests take (at the time I write this) about 1.5s to
42sh$ #                    run, better skipping them if you don't need them
42sh$ # -D_TXX_MAIN: Enable Main function, those last 2 flags might have their
42sh$ #              defaults flipped later on, but whilst I'm still in
42sh$ #              development phase, I'd rather have those defaults
42sh$ # -D_TXX_INPUT: the value of the `Input` type in `body.txx`
42sh$ # -Itxx: Include path
42sh$ # -o /dev/null: Executable is pointless
42sh$ g++ -std=c++23 -pedantic -D_TXX_SKIP_TESTS -D_TXX_MAIN -D_TXX_INPUT="bu10" -Itxx main.cc -o /dev/null
```

### What's Implemented

The language currently supports:

- **Booleans**: `True`, `False`, with `And`, `Or`, `Not`, `Xor`
- **Numbers**:
  - `BigUnsigned`: Arbitrary-precision unsigned integers with full arithmetic
  - `Unsigned8`: 8-bit unsigned integers with full arithmetic
- **Lists**: Heterogeneous lists with `Map`, `Filter`, `Fold`, `Zip`, `Take`,
  `Drop`, `Reverse`, `Concat`, `Nth`, `Set`, and more
- **First-class functions**: `Apply`, `Curry`, `Combine` (composition), `Flip`,
  `Const`, `Id`, `On`, and `Ternary` (if-then-else)
