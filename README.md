Basicly the goal is to create a functional language using only the C++ Type
System. No literals, No standard library, no constexpr, just the Typesystem.
In other words, there are 0 (zero) *values* in the code, just Types.

The goal would be to be able to solve a few [Advent of
Code](https://adventofcode.com/) exercises using only this.

I was very much inspired by my former colleague's
[funxx](https://github.com/VokunGahrotLaas/funxx), but wanted to go even
further.

Maybe I'll investigate also doing a Dedekindâ€“Peano Natural Number Type.

### Lists

- [x] Prepend
- [x] Append
- [x] Reverse
- [ ] Set i-th
- [ ] AllOf
- [ ] NoneOf
- [x] Map
- [x] FoldL
- [x] FoldR
- [ ] i-th
- [ ] Concat

### Functions

- [x] Functions
- [x] Apply
- [x] Ternary
- [ ] Combine
- [ ] Curry
- [ ] Uncurry

### Others

Structures that would be nice to have natively:
- [ ] Sets
- [ ] Maps
- [ ] Graphs

- Tuples: since the list I have has many types already, they kinda are tuples,
  but formalizing a tuple type would allow for some practicle things, like
  wrapping a result type in a tuple that can be converted back to a parameter
  pack and vice-versa (since we can't do `using result = ParameterPack...;`)
